        <p>
          Before I ever wrote a single line of code, I was on a very different path ‚Äî the priesthood.
          I entered the seminary of the <strong>Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter</strong>, where I began
          studying classical <strong>Thomistic philosophy</strong>. It was a time of deep intellectual and spiritual formation,
          shaped by the teachings of St. Thomas Aquinas and a desire to dedicate my life to a greater calling.
        </p>
        <p>
          After three years of formation, however, I came to realize that I was not called to this vocation. I returned
          to my homeland, <strong>Croatia</strong>, unsure of what the next chapter would look like. In the midst of this
          transition, a friend of mine suggested I try learning to program ‚Äî he saw something in me I hadn&rsquo;t yet seen
          in myself. That was in <strong>late August 2024</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          It took some time to truly find motivation, but once I began, I discovered something incredible. Programming
          opened a whole new world ‚Äî a place where logic, creativity, and problem-solving come together. What fascinates
          me the most is how a simple idea can be turned into something real, functional, and even beautiful ‚Äî all through code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, in <strong>April 2025</strong>, I&rsquo;ve launched this blog to document my developer journey. I&rsquo;m preparing
          to build my first real project soon and look forward to everything I&rsquo;ll learn along the way.

          From metaphysics to machine code ‚Äî it&rsquo;s been a surprising journey, but I&rsquo;m just getting started.
