            <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
              Before I ever wrote a single line of code, I was on a very different path ‚Äî the priesthood.
              I entered the seminary of the <strong>Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter</strong>, where I began
              studying classical <strong>Thomistic philosophy</strong>. It was a time of deep intellectual and spiritual formation,
              shaped by the teachings of St. Thomas Aquinas and a desire to dedicate my life to a greater calling.
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
              After three years of formation, however, I came to realize that I was not called to this vocation. I returned
              to my homeland, <strong>Croatia</strong>, unsure of what the next chapter would look like. In the midst of this
              transition, a friend of mine suggested I try learning to program ‚Äî he saw something in me I hadn‚Äôt yet seen
              in myself. That was in <strong>late August 2024</strong>.
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
              It took some time to truly find motivation, but once I began, I discovered something incredible. Programming
              opened a whole new world ‚Äî a place where logic, creativity, and problem-solving come together. What fascinates
              me the most is how a simple idea can be turned into something real, functional, and even beautiful ‚Äî all through code.
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
              Now, in <strong>April 2025</strong>, I‚Äôve launched this blog to document my developer journey. I‚Äôm preparing
              to build my first real project soon and look forward to everything I‚Äôll learn along the way.

              From metaphysics to machine code ‚Äî it‚Äôs been a surprising journey, but I‚Äôm just getting started.
