            Before I ever wrote a single line of code, I was on a very different path ‚Äî the priesthood.
            I entered the seminary of the <strong>Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter</strong>, where I began studying classical <strong>Thomistic philosophy</strong>.
            It was a time of deep intellectual and spiritual formation, shaped by the teachings of St. Thomas Aquinas and a desire to dedicate my life to a greater calling.
            <br /><br />
            After three years of formation, however, I came to realize that I was not called to this vocation.
            I returned to my homeland, <strong>Croatia</strong>, unsure of what the next chapter would look like.
            In the midst of this transition, a friend of mine suggested I try learning to program ‚Äî he saw something in me I hadn&rsquo;t yet seen in myself.
            That was in <strong>late August 2024</strong>.
            <br /><br />
            It took some time to truly find motivation, but once I began, I discovered something incredible.
            Programming opened a whole new world ‚Äî a place where logic, creativity, and problem-solving come together.
            What fascinates me the most is how a simple idea can be turned into something real, functional, and even beautiful ‚Äî all through code.
            <br /><br />
            Now, in <strong>April 2025</strong>, I&rsquo;ve launched this blog to document my developer journey.
            I&rsquo;m preparing to build my first real project soon and look forward to everything I&rsquo;ll learn along the way.
            <br /><br />
            <em>From metaphysics to machine code ‚Äî it&rsquo;s been a surprising journey, but I&rsquo;m just getting started.</em>
